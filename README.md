In this project we can read mutiple json files and read the data from json files.
The JSONObject and HashMap are mainly used for merging all the json files.
After merging all the JSONFiles we can store it in an array called as Strikers
Then using object.put()we can store all the merged objects to JSONObjects
Finally the output can be written into a JSONFile
